## Introduction
555 Timer ICâ€™s are the most commonly used ICs for timing and Pulse generation applications. They can adopt itself into various applications due to its different operating modes: Astable Mode, Monostable Mode and Bi-Stable Mode. Each mode has its own properties and applications since every mode provides a different type of wave forms.
This 555 timer monostable circuit calculator can be used to 
*	Get the output pulse width (delay time). In Monostable mode of 555 timer IC, when power is applied, the output remains low for the Delay time and then becomes high and remains high, or vice versa.
*	Along with that, the program also automatically computes the resistor value from the colour bands entered and capacitor value from the code entered.

To avoid all this hassle of data conversion and calculation you can use the 555 timer monostable calculator given above to calculate the value of Time duration.
