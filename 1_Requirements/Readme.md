## Introduction
555 Timer ICâ€™s are the most commonly used ICs for timing and Pulse generation applications. They can adopt itself into various applications due to its different operating modes: Astable Mode, Monostable Mode and Bi-Stable Mode. Each mode has its own properties and applications since every mode provides a different type of wave forms.

This **555 timer monostable circuit calculator** can be used to get the output pulse width (delay time). In Monostable mode of 555 timer IC, when power is applied, the output remains low for the Delay time and then becomes high and remains high, or vice versa.To avoid all the hassle of data conversion and calculation you can use the 555 timer monostable calculator given above to calculate the value of time duration of the pulse.

This is a simple circuit to make the 555 timer IC to work in Monostable mode. Whenever the push button connected to Trigger pin (pin 2) is pressed a trigger pulse is detected by the 555 IC and so it will trigger the output pulse on its output pin (pin 3) as shown in the waveform below.

This output pulse will stay high based on its pulse width. This output pulse width sets the pre-defined time and as said earlier it can be set by selecting the correct values of Resistor (R) and Capacitor (C) using the below formulae.

   **Output Pulse Width (secs) = 1.1 x R x C**
   
   **Features:**

This 555 timer monostable circuit calculator can be used to 
*	Get the output pulse width (delay time). In Monostable mode of 555 timer IC, when power is applied, the output remains low for the Delay time and then becomes high and remains high, or vice versa.
*	Along with that, the program also automatically computes the resistor value from the colour bands entered and capacitor value from the code entered by the user.

**Benefits:**

*	This combines 3 different calculators- A Resistor band Calculator, A Capacitance code calculator and a 555 Timer Pulse Width Calculator. All the three can be calculated at one place.
*	These is no confusion for Data conversion and calculation. Easy to use.
*	No need to look through the spec sheet and the hand calculator any time one needs to find the values for a one-shot monostable setup.
